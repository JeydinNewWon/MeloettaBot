# Installation

1. Download this repository by clicking the green download button on the top right and choose the .ZIP option. Open the .ZIP file and drag the extracted folder to your Desktop.
2. Go to the [python dowloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install the latest version of Python 3. **DON'T INSTALL PYTHON 2.** Once the installation is complete, open your Applications folder (on your dock); open the Python 3.6 folder, then click the "Install Ce...ommand". Wait for it to complete.
3. Open the Command Line, (Terminal) on your laptop, and copy+paste the following code:
```
cd ~/Desktop/Meloetta-public/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Open your code editor and open `config.ini` in the config folder **inside the editor**.
5. Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and create a bot application or open an existing one. **MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CREATED A BOT USER**. Add all the data as instructed into config.ini. **The most important being the bot's token, which is found by scrolling down on your application page after creating a Bot User Account.**
6. Then run this in Terminal,
```
cd ~/Desktop/Meloetta-public/
python3 bot.py
```
7. When the bot prints its details out on the console, it means it's online and working!
